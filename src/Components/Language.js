            Banjaras speak Gour Boli; also called Banjara, Banjary it belongs to
            the Indo-Aryan group of languages. As Banjara, Lambadi has no
            script, it is either written in Devanagari script or in the script
            of the local language such as Telugu or Kannada. Many Banjaras today
            are bilingual or multilingual, adopting the predominant language of
            their surroundings, but those that continue to live in areas of
            dense Banjara population persist with their traditional language. "
            Kesula Nai Mora ri, Maayad Bhasha Banjara ri. Chanda Suryasyu Amraa
            ri, Jeeve Jeevesyu Pyari." (Banjara is my mother tongue. Blooming
            like a flowers. She is immortal like the Moon and the Sun. She is
            dearer to us than life.) This is considered the pride song of
            Banjara language. This popular composition of Eknath Pawar- Nayak

            Telangana state has introduced two textbooks in Banjara language for
            primary school children in 1,426 Tanda's in the State. Gour Banjaras
            have their own mother tongue called ‘Gorboli’, Banjary and it is
            spoken by people living across India. According to their names their
            language is also known by various names such as Lamani, Lambadi,
            Lambani, Brinjari, Gourmati, Banjara, Lubhani and variants. Regional
            dialects are divided between the Banjaras of MH (written in Marathi
            and Hindi by using Devanagari script), KK (written in the Kannada
            script), AP and TS (written in the Telugu script). They are
            bilingual and speak in Hindi or Marathi or Kannada or Telugu along
            with their mother tongue ‘Gorboli’, but there is an influence of
            regional languages on their ‘Banjaras’ language. As such the actual
            number of ‘Gorboli Banjara’ speakers is not known since the census
            is not being enumerated based on language for the last many years.
