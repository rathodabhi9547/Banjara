            All of the Banjara people profess faith in Hinduism and follow Hindu
            culture. They are known to worship deities such as Balaji, Goddess
            Jagadamba Devi, Goddess Bhavani, Renuka Mata of Mahur and
            Hanuman.[citation needed] They also hold Guru Nanak in great
            respect. However, the Banjaras have been "ambiguous" with regard to
            religion and were "tolerant and syncretic", according to Satya. He
            notes, like Habib, that some banjaras those who had settled in the
            Wun district of Berar must have annoyed local Brahmins by preferring
            to use the services of their own priests rather than of that
            priestly caste. Further, they were associated with the Mahanubhava
            sect which led to a belief in Krishna and "a casual attitude towards
            cohabitation". Sevalal or Sevabhaya is the most important saint of
            the Banjaras. According to their accounts, he was born on 15
            February 1739 and died on 4 December 1806. A cattle merchant by
            profession he is said to have been a man of exemplary truthfulness,
            a great musician, a courageous warrior, a rationalist who fought
            against superstition and a devotee of the goddess Jagadamba. The
            colonial British administrators also quote his stories but they
            place him in the 19th century and identify his original name as Siva
            Rathor. The tribe has evolved and more people in the tribe started
            following natural religions. This is due to invasions, colonisation
            and partition of India. There Muslim Banjara mainly in Sindh region
            of Pakistan. Some Banjara people became Laban started following
            Sikhism. After the British Raj and independence Christianity entered
            into the Banjara culture by missionaries. But, majority of the
            Banjara community follow their own independent customs and Hindu
            religion.
